Mukund Bansal

Software Engineer focused on Java, Data Structures & Algorithms, and scalable system design.

I approach development with a systems mindset — understanding how components interact, scale, and evolve rather than just writing isolated code.

Currently strengthening backend fundamentals, problem-solving skills, and exploring modern system architecture concepts including AI and Cloud technologies.
